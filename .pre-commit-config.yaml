# Multi-Agent Coordination Template - Pre-commit Config

# This configuration uses the pre-commit framework to manage git hooks.
# Benefits:
#   - Multiple hooks can coexist (template hooks + your custom hooks)
#   - Language-agnostic (works for any project)
#   - Easy to add/remove hooks
#   - Hooks are version controlled

# Installation:
#   pip install pre-commit
#   ./.claude/workflow/hooks --install

# See https://pre-commit.com for more information

repos:
  # Template hooks (commit message validation)
  - repo: local

        name: Claude Commit Message Format
